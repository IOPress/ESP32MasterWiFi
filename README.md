You can browse the repo if you simply want to read the code. If you want to use the repo to run the code then you can either download it as a zip file and unzip it to a suitable directory or you can use Source Control and Clone repo using a URL.

Once you have the files installed you can work with any of the examples by opening the folder with the correct chapter number and then the folder of the example you want to work with. Notice that examples in different chapters can have the same name.

Once you have the folder open in VSCode you will need to make sure that the flash method and ESP32 device type are
correctly set. Generally if you can start a new project using the extension and can compile and run it then
you should be able to compile and run an example in one of the chapters.

There are also various configuration details that have to be entered for the programs to work. 
In particular you need to supply and ssid and password for the WiFi AP you want to connect to. 
In general if you see any errors about not being able to find a file check the path is correct on your machine.
